**Your Rights Regarding Personal Information**

You have the right to:

* **Request access** to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This allows you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to verify its lawful processing.
* **Request correction** of your personal information. You can have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. Verification of the accuracy of new information may be required.
* **Request the erasure** of your personal information. You can ask us to delete or remove personal information when there is no valid reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal information if you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing, if we have unlawfully processed your information, or if local law mandates erasure. Please note that specific legal reasons may prevent us from complying with your erasure request, and we will notify you of this when applicable.
* **Object to processing** of your personal information when we rely on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing based on this ground. You also have the right to object when we process your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In certain cases, we may demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your rights and freedoms.
* **Request restriction** of processing of your personal information. This allows you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in specific situations:
  * (a) When you want us to establish the information's accuracy.
  * (b) If our use of the information is unlawful, but you do not want it erased.
  * (c) When you need us to retain the information even though we no longer require it, as you need it for legal claims.
  * (d) When you have objected to our use of your information, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds for its use.
* **Request data transfer** of your personal information to you or a third party. We will provide your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right applies only to automated information you initially provided consent for or information used to fulfill a contract with you.
* **Withdraw consent** at any time if we rely on consent to process your personal information. This will not affect the legality of any processing carried out before consent withdrawal. However, certain services may not be provided if you withdraw your consent, and we will inform you of such instances.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the provided details.

**No Fee Usually Required**

Accessing your personal information (or exercising any other rights) does not typically require a fee. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What We May Need From You**

To confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or exercise any other rights), we may need specific information from you. This is a security measure to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of personal information.

We may also contact you to request additional information to expedite our response.

**Response Time**

We strive to respond to all valid requests within one month. On occasion, if a request is particularly complex or if multiple requests have been made, it may take longer than a month. In such cases, we will inform you and provide updates.

**Effective Date: October 15, 2023.**
